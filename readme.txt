Quickly and easily password protect a site to keep it from the prying eyes of google.

== Description ==

Enable protect access for site by HTTP AUTH for a user/pw before being able to view the frontend.

Aim of the plugin is to protect staging sites from the prying eyes of search engine robots, and to keep out anyone who might stumble across it accidentally.

This isn't particularly secure - password is in the database.
